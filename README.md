# CGMacros-Analysis---Python-and-Power-BI
This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard built to visualize subject-level insights across glycemic response, microbiome composition, metabolic risk markers, and macronutrient intake.

The source data was taken from physionet: https://physionet.org/content/cgmacros/1.0.0/

# Objective:
To support personalized nutrition and health recommendations by analyzing individual biometrics, gut health, and glucose variability.

# Key Features:
Biometrics and Clinical Indicators:
Tracking key health markers like HbA1c, BMI, and fasting glucose to assess metabolic risk.

Subject-Level Health Insights:
Personalizing analysis using demographics and vital signs to contextualize health status.

Microbial and Gut Health:
Evaluating gut microbiome composition to understand its influence on glucose and inflammation.

Meal and Macronutrient Intake:
Analyzing the impact of calories, carbs, fats, protein, and fiber from each meal on health.

Glucose Response Trends:
Identifying glucose spikes and patterns across time, meals, and nutrient combinations.

# Tools Used
- Jupiter Notebook (used Python for data cleaning and preprocessing)
- Power BI (Data modeling & visualizations)
- Excel (source data - CSV files )

# Project Structure
Folder 'Cleaned Data' consists of all cleaned files, preprocessed from source data taken from physionet (https://physionet.org/content/cgmacros/1.0.0/)
Folder 'Files Used for cleaning Data' consists of all the python files used for cleaning the data. 
CGMacros_visualizations.pbix file contains the visualizations for the analysis of the GCMacros data. 
Data_Processing_Report.docx and Insights.docx give the details about cleaning and issights respectively.

# Insights
The visualizations dashboard can assist clinicians, dietitians, or researchers in delivering precision lifestyle recommendations based on detailed subject-level analytics and the glucose response trends.
